The proposed formulation includes the variational equation, predictor multi-corrector algorithms and boundary conditions. The variational equation is based on the time-discontinuous Galerkin method, in which the physical entropy variables are employed. A least-squares operator and a discontinuity-capturing operator are added, resulting in a high-order accurate and unconditionally stable method. Implicit/explicit predictor multi-corrector algorithms, applicable to steady as well as unsteady problems, are presented; techniques are developed to enhance their efficiency. Implementation of boundary conditions is addressed; in particular, a technique is introduced to satisfy nonlinear essential boundary conditions, and a consistent method is presented to calculate boundary fluxes. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the method. "

These methods are an extension of the Runge-Kutta discontinuous Galerkin (RKDG) methods for purely hyperbolic systems to convection-diffusion systems and share with those methods their high parallelizability, high-order formal accuracy, and easy handling of complicated geometries for convection-dominated problems. It is proven that for scalar equations, the LDG methods are L2-stable in the nonlinear case. Moreover, in the linear case, it is shown that if polynomials of degree k are used, the methods are kth order accurate for general triangulations; although this order of convergence is suboptimal, it is sharp for the LDG methods. Preliminary numerical examples displaying the performance of the method are shown.},
